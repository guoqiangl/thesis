\chapter[Fingerprint Identification System]{Fingerprint Identification System}\label{CH:fingerprintidentificaiotnsystem}


\section{Introduction}\label{CH:Introduction:Introduction}

Some of humans' characteristics (such as face, voice and handwritten signature) have been used to recognize individuals in our daily lives. However, we have difficulty to recognize the individuals who are not close or familiar persons by using these characteristics. A solution to assist human with the purpose of identification is \textit{biometric system} which is an automated pattern recognition system to verify or recognize the identity of individuals based on their behavioural characteristics (such as gait, signature, keystroke dynamic, etc.) and biological characteristics (such as fingerprint, face, iris, etc.)~\cite{maltoni2009handbook, ISOStandardVocabulary, jain2004introduction}. A variety of biometric systems have been deployed and even used for a long history in law enforcement agencies and commercial area.

With the rapid improvement of the processing capability, memory and sensors in modern devices, a couple of large-scale biometric systems have became operational or been developing around the world. In U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) IAFIS (Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System) major components become operational early in 1999~\cite{BiometricsHistory, FBI_IAFIS}, and it is hosting more than 70 million subjects with criminal background and 34 million civil prints according to the FBI's IAFIS website~\cite{FBI_IAFIS}. US-VISIT (United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology) program became operational in 2004~\cite{BiometricsHistory, US_VISA_pogram}, and collected fingerprints and face image from more than 90 million subjects~\cite{sankaran2015multisensor}. In Europe, The Visa Information System (VIS) was introduced in October 2011 to exchange visa data within Schengen States~\cite{VIS_StartDate, VIS_EuropeWeb}. Over 20 million applications have been processed so far~\cite{VIS_EULISA}, and every applicant has to provide his/her fingerprints and a digital photograph since October, 2015. In Asia, India has been working on the world's largest biometric identity system (UIA of India) which aims to issue a 12-digit unique identity number for each resident in a country with 1.2 billion population~\cite{India_AadhaarProject}. This unique identity number is guaranteed by collecting the biometric data from each resident including fingerprint, iris and face. So far, over 1 billion have enrolled in this system. Table~\ref{Table_LargeScaleSystems} lists these notable large-scale applications.

%The first scientific paper on fingerprint was published in 1684 by N.Grew how gave the definition of ridge, furrow, and pore structure in a fingerprint~\cite{lee2001advances}. In 1892, Sir Francis Galton defined an important fingerprint characteristics $minutia$ which is till using today~\cite{GaltonWebsite}. Another important advance on fingerprint is the development of Henry classification system which was made by Edward Henry in 1896~\cite{karu1996fingerprint}. The Henry system categorizes the fingerprints into give groups: right loop, left loop, arch, whorl and tented arch in order to facilitate searching in a fingerprint database. The first research paper on fingerprint automatic comparison was published in 1963~\cite{trauring1963automatic}, then FBI started developing an automate fingerprint identification system in 1969~\cite{woodward2003biometrics}.


Based on the context of these applications, a biometric system can be categorized into the following two types of systems:

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item[\bullet] \textbf{Verification system} compares the biometric data captured from a presented individual with a corresponding biometric data (for instance, links to the presented person by an username) pre-stored in the database, which indicates a 1:1 comparison as seen in~\ref{fig:Introduction_Verification:a}.  The purpose of verification system is to confirm the identity of the presented individual by outputting a binary result ``Ture or False'' in order to answer a question ``Is this person who he/she claims?''.
\item[\bullet] \textbf{Identification system} compares the captured biometric data from a presented individual with all biometric data stored in the database which indicates a 1:$N$ comparisons, where $N$ is the total number of subjects enrolled in the database as seen in~\ref{fig:Introduction_Verification:b}. The purpose of identification system is to establish the identity of the presented individual. Generally speaking, this system tries to answer a question ``who is this person?'', and will output the result: identity of the presented individual or ``this person is not enrolled /\ identified''.   
\end{itemize}

From the technical perspective, the major difference between biometric verification system and identification system is the number of comparisons (1 comparison for verification versus $N$ comparisons for identification). This $N$ depends on the number of subjects enrolled in the database, thus the accuracy and response time of the identification system will be critical when the database contains more than millions of subjects, such as the system listed in Table. And we also can see that fingerprint is the common biometric modality which is selected by all these systems, which also indicates the uniqueness of the fingerprint even operating at a large-scale level. Sometimes fingerprint-based biometric system becomes the synonym of the biometric system due to its popularity especially used in law enforcement community~\cite{davies1994touching}. 

We focus on fingerprint identification system. Fingerprint is composed of a series of flow-like ridge and furrows on the surface of human fingers~\cite{lee2001advances, maltoni2009handbook}, and it has been used to verify the identity of humans for a long history. The first scientific paper on fingerprint was published in 1684 by N.Grew how gave the definition of ridge, furrow, and pore structure in a fingerprint~\cite{lee2001advances}. The first research paper on fingerprint automatic comparison was published in 1963~\cite{trauring1963automatic}. A lot of fingerprint recognition algorithms have published and been applied to the practical systems. However, new challenges occur when we incorporate fingerprint recognition with new technology and devices, such as smartphone. And a shorter response time is still desirable while the database size of the existing fingerprint identification system is continuously growing. People are also getting concerned about the security and privacy of their biometric data when everything comes to online.

In this dissertation, we will address several research aspects related to large-scale fingerprint identification systems. Some of these research aspects also can be applied to a biometric verification system. The following section will give an overview of research aspects which researchers are commonly working on for a fingerprint identification system. Then we will present our research objectives and research questions in Section~\ref{CH:Introduction:researchAspects}. Section~\ref{CH:introduction:structure} describes the structure of this dissertation. The terminology used in this dissertation refers to ISO/IEC International Standard 2382:2012~\cite{ISOStandardVocabulary}. 

\section{Research Aspects in a Fingerprint Identification System}\label{CH:Introduction:researchAspects}

\end{figure}

A fingerprint identification system generally consists of two stage: enrollment and identification as shown in Figure~\ref{InrotuctionIdentificationSturcture}. There are four modules in each stage including three common modules which are data acquisition module, pre-processing module and template creation module. 

Data acquisition module captures the fingerprint sample from the finger of an individual by using a dedicated sensor or any device which can obtain the ridge and furrow pattern of the finger. A research aspect used in data acquisition module is to assess the fingerprint sample quality before further processing, especially for enrolment stage. For instance, it would increase the system error rate if an image without a fingerprint is enrolled as a reference in the database. Therefore the fingerprint sample quality assessment is an essential component during the data acquisition in order to not negatively affect the system error rate. In practical scenario, a re-capture action will be activated once the quality of captured sample doesn't meeting the requirement of a fingerprint sample quality assessment component. 


\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption[An example of fingerprint sample pre-processing]{An example of fingerprint sample pre-processing. The sample is selected from FVC\_2002~\cite{FVC2002Website}, and the right two pictures are adopted from~\cite{Pre_processing_photo}.}
\label{Figure_example_pre_processing}
\end{figure}

Pre-processing module involves several research aspects: segmentation, orientation field estimation, ridge enhancement, binarization and thinning~\cite{tsai2013fingerprint}. The goal of fingerprint segmentation is to decompose the fingerprint sample image into two parts: the foreground which is the region of interest (ridges and furrows), and the background. Fingerprint segmentation is important for an automated identification system, since it can prevent extracting spurious features from the background region. Following the fingerprint segmentation is the orientation filed estimation which heavily affect the subsequent processes~\cite{zhou2004model}. For instance, the directional filtering in ridge enhancement highly relies on the ridge direction flow~\cite{jain2000filterbank}, and a variety of singularity detection methods~\cite{bo2008fingerprint, karu1996fingerprint} are based on Poincor\'e index which is calculated from orientation field. The other research aspects related to pre-processing module are ridge enhancement, binarization and thinning. Figure~\ref{Figure_example_pre_processing} illustrates an example how to pre-process a raw sample by applying segmentation, orientation field estimation, enhancement, binarization and thinning modules. After pre-processing, a fingerprint template can be generated by extracting the features from processed image (such as, the bottom-left image in Figure~\ref{Figure_example_pre_processing}). 

A commonly used fingerprint template is minutia based template, since minutia is considered as the most robust feature and also has been standardized in ISO/IEC 19794-2~\cite{ISOStandardSeven}. Some other features also may be included in fingerprint template are singular points information, ridge information, or pore information~\cite{singh2009fingerprint}. A fingerprint-based biometric system generally stores fingerprint templates rather than raw fingerprint images. Storing fingerprint template has the advantages to save storage space and reduce response time during comparison, since pre-processing step can be addressed offline at enrolment stage. However, some researchers have revealed that the original fingerprint information could be reconstructed from the fingerprint template~ \cite{cappelli2007fingerprint, feng2011fingerprint}. Thus storing fingerprint template in plaintext domain maybe risky, especially the biometric data can be misused in the rest of our life once it is compromised. This leads to another important research aspect: fingerprint template protection which has been studied more than a decade, but hasn't been solved perfectly. 





During identification stage, a crucial module is the comparison algorithm (or called verification algorithm) which commonly extracts robust features from fingerprint template in order to produce a similarity score between a reference template and a probe template. Due to the sample translation and rotation commonly occurred at data acquisition, another research aspect involved in a comparison algorithm is fingerprint alignment. The system performance would be significantly improved if the samples from the same source can be aligned properly, however, it is quite challenging to achieve. As we mentioned in previous section, a fingerprint identification system might perform $N$ comparisons using the probe fingerprint against all $N$ enrolled fingerprint. However, this operation could be time consuming when this $N$ comes to a large-scale level as mentioned in previous section. In order to shorten the response time, a natural thought is to reduce the number of comparisons by dividing the whole database into several subsets. Then the probe sample is only needed to compare with the fingerprint in a single subset based on this probe's class. A famous classification method is called Henry classification system which was made by Edward Henry in 1896~\cite{karu1996fingerprint}. The Henry classification system categorizes the fingerprints into five groups: arch, tented arch, left loop, right loop and whorl. Ideally, the number of comparisons can be reduced 80\% after this classification if the fingerprints are evenly distributed to these five classes. But the distribution of fingerprints in these five classes is uneven: 3.7\% arch, 2.9\% tented arch, 33.8\% left loop, 31.7\% right loop and 27.9\% whorl according to the result published in~\cite{maltoni2009handbook, wilson1994neural}. In addition, the number of classes in Henry classification is limited, since 20\% searching space is still large for a large-scale fingerprint identification system with millions of subjected enrolled. Another solution to reduce the number of comparisons is fingerprint indexing which retrieves a short list of potential candidates which will be further used by a verification algorithm. In other word, fingerprint indexing is a pre-selection algorithm, and a fingerprint identification system can be divided into two sequential steps: fingerprint indexing and fingerprint verification. With the help of fingerprint indexing, the number of comparisons can be significantly reduced. In general, a fingerprint indexing algorithm can be studied from two aspects: (1) extracting robust features which are suitable for creating index space; (2) building index space and retrieving candidates. The following section will discuss the research aspects that we have chosen to work in this dissertation.

It is difficult to cover all research aspects involved in the fingerprint identification system in one dissertation, hence we selected several aspects which we consider are either rarely studied or crucial for a large-scale fingerprint identification system.  

Controlling the quality of the fingerprint sample during data acquisition is a crucial step for any fingerprint recognition based biometric system. The first research topic selected for this dissertation is to assess the quality of a fingerprint sample captured from a smartphone's camera. This fingerprint sample captured from smartphone's camera or touchless device is also called fingerphoto, since it is technically the same as a normal image taken by a camera which generally contains diverse background. There are two main reasons that why we decided to work on fingerphoto quality assessment: (1) smartphone has become a part of our life, and the embedded camera (high resolution, auto-focus) as well as other hardwares (such as powerful chipset, memory etc.) embedded in the smartphone have the capabilities to make smartphone's camera as an alternative of a dedicated fingerprint sensor. This also brings the convenience and low-cost on the sensor; (2) a lot of researcher have extensively worked on the quality assessment for the fingerprint captured by a dedicated sensor, however, fingerphoto quality assessment is rarely studied.

%%%leaked data maybe used in other application, cross-match.
People are concerned about the security and privacy of their biometric data. Last year, the Office of Personnel Management in U.S. said that there are 5.6 million fingerprints stolen in a cyberattack~\cite{US_DB_breach}. Recently, a massive data breach put fingerprints from 55 million Philippine voters in danger~\cite{Philippine_DB_breach}. On April 14, 2016, EU General Data Protection Regulation (``GDPR'') became law, and biometric data is recognized as sensitive data which requires extra protection. Thus security is important for the biometric data. The Second research aspect selected for this dissertation is fingerprint template protection.

The third research aspect that we chose to work on is fingerprint indexing which is very important for a large-scale fingerprint identification system. Figure~\ref{Inrotuction_motivation_fingerprint_indexing} gives an example to explain why it is important. Let's assume there is a fingerprint to to identified by comparing it to all enrolled references in FBI IAFIS database storing fingerprints from 104 million subjects with 10 fingers recorded. Then the number of comparisons is 1.04 billion. On the other hand, NeuroTechnology Verifinger 7.1 matcher has the capability to compare 40,000 fingerprints per second under a maximized matching speed scenario~\cite{NeuroTechnology_Verifinger_Matcher_7}. In the end, the response time will be more than 7 hours if we perform an exhaustive searching (compare the fingerprint to be identified against all the references enrolled in the database). In order to shorten this response time, we decided to work on fingerprint indexing which can facilitate searching in a large-scale fingerprint identification system. Besides studying the fingerprint indexing algorithm without considering security mechanism, we also decided to explore combining fingerprint indexing with security mechanism.


Based on the above research objectives, this dissertation is focusing on answering a number of research questions as listed below:

\begin{itemize}

\item[\textit{RQ_1}] \textbf{How to assess the quality of the fingerphoto taken by a general-purposed smartphone's camera in a real-life scenario?}


%\item[\textit{RQ_2}] \textbf{Is it possible to measure the fingerprint orientation of the arch fingerprint which doesn't have a singular point?}




\item[\textit{RQ_2}] \textbf{What features can be extracted from the fingerprint template and are suitable for a fingerprint indexing algorithm?}



\item[\textit{RQ_3}] \textbf{How to build the index space and retrieve candidate identities in a fingerprint indexing algorithm?}


\item[\textit{RQ_4}] \textbf{What fingerprint template protection can be developed besides the existing methods in the literature?}


\item[\textit{RQ_5}] \textbf{Is it feasible to develop a fast fingerprint indexing algorithm that also can protect the fingerprint template?}


\end{itemize}

% we can group the above research questions into 3 classes,
We grouped the research questions into three main parts and structured this dissertation accordingly : fingerphoto quality assessment, fingerprint indexing and security enhancement. A brief introduction of each part is given as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] Part \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1} is an introduction. The remaining of this first part consists of two chapters: the following chapter gives an elaborate overview of the state of the art on the research aspects selected for this dissertation; the Chapter 3 describes the contributions of this dissertation as well as a list of publications.
\item[$\bullet$] Part \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3} and \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral4} are composed of a number of research papers which can be categorised into three main research aspects: fingerphoto quality assessment, fingerprint indexing and security enhancement. Figure~\ref{StructureOfMianPart} gives a block diagram which illustrates the structure of the main part of this thesis. The first column of this figure gives some general components in a fingerprint identification system. The third column lists the main features that we have worked for each research aspect. This figure would be helpful to guide the reader, and will be displayed in the beginning of each part along with a description of the topics that are discussed in that part.
\item[$\bullet$] Part \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral5} draws the conclusions and proposes the future work which can be further studied.
\item[$\bullet$] Part \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral6} is the appendix where we discussed two topics. Firstly, we proposed an approach to measure the orientation for the arch fingerprint by taking an input point with high curvature. This is semi-automated approach which is the reason that we don't include it in the main part. However, this approach can be further improved to an automated approach and integrated into the fingerprint identification system. Secondly, we investigated what would be the performance in terms of accuracy when we identify an individual by using the fingerphotos taken by a smartphone under real-life scenarios. The experimental results on this investigation is not desirable, which motivated to study on fingerphoto quality assessment. As seen in Figure~\ref{StructureOfAppendixPart}, these two topics can be classified into two research aspects respectively: fingerprint alignment and fingerphoto recognition. We believe these two research aspects deserve to be studied in depth. 
\end{itemize}
%. The second chapter of this part gives an overview of the state of the art on four research aspects selected for this dissertation. The second part is composed of the publications which addressed these research aspects and questions listed in Section~\ref{ResearchObjectivesAndQuestions}. We lists all research aspects in blocks as seen in Figure~\ref{StructureOfComponents}. These blocks follows the work flow of a fingerprint identification system starting from data acquisition to enrolment/comparison. At the beginning of each research paper, we highlight the research aspects which have been discussed. The efficiency of a large-scale fingerprint identification system is a critical requirement, and the fingerprint indexing algorithm is the key to achieve that. It would be interesting to see how the developed fingerprint indexing algorithms perform in a large-scale database. We evaluate the indexing algorithms on a dataset containing 250,000 subjects enrolled in database and 50,000 subjects used as probes for searching. The performance is reported in the third part. The contributions, conclusions and future work are given in the forth part.
